\section{Introduction}

The group was assigned with the task of testing a complex, and possibly not delivery-ready system used to maintain software used in the control units for a modern car; SoCam. SoCam was desgined to support the following high-level functionalities:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Insert new software or new versions of software into a software database.
    \item Maintain a database that shows which control units need which software.
    \item Send alarm (recall) if critical defects are discovered.
    \item Assist the garage in updating car software.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent SoCam was divided into two systems: (1) the garage system, and (2) the manufacturer system system. The two divided systems communicated through a network. The requirements of these divided systems will be further dissected in section \ref{section:risk_analysis}.


The purpose of this assignment was to perform a risk analysis where the requirements of the system was evaluated in terms of consequence and probability before the system was tested. Further a test strategy was devised and the tests were executed accordingly. Based on the risk analysis and the results of the test, the readiness of the system will be evaluated.
